- [ ] Rate limiting configured on public endpoints
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] API keys rotated and secured

### Performance
- [x] Database indexes added for frequently queried columns
- [x] Query result caching implemented
- [x] Image lazy loading enabled
- [x] Bundle size optimized
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] Compression enabled (gzip/brotli)

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests passing (100% coverage on utilities)
- [x] Integration tests passing
- [x] E2E tests passing
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Security testing completed

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry recommended)
- [ ] Analytics tracking setup
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Database monitoring active
- [ ] Log aggregation configured

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

Create production environment variables:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-production-url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-production-key
```

### 2. Build Optimization

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run production build
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### 3. Database Migration

Ensure all migrations are applied:
```bash
# Review pending migrations
npm run db:status

# Apply migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

### 4. Domain Configuration

1. Go to Lovable Project Settings > Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records:
   - A record: points to Lovable server IP
   - CNAME record: www subdomain
4. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning (automatic)

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Database queries execute properly
- [ ] File uploads working
- [ ] Email notifications sending
- [ ] Invoice generation functional
- [ ] All critical user flows tested

## Performance Optimization

### Database
- Indexes created on frequently queried columns ✅
- Query result caching enabled (5 min cache, 2 min stale) ✅
- Connection pooling configured ✅

### Frontend
- Code splitting by route ✅
- Lazy loading for heavy components ✅
- Image lazy loading with intersection observer ✅
- Virtual scrolling for large lists ✅

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Configure CDN for static assets
2. Enable compression (handled by Lovable)
3. Add service worker for offline support
4. Implement progressive web app (PWA) features

## Monitoring Setup

### Error Tracking (Recommended: Sentry)
```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "your-sentry-dsn",
  environment: "production",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Use Web Vitals API for Core Web Vitals
- Monitor database query performance
- Track API response times
- Monitor error rates

### Health Checks
Create health check endpoints:
- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/health/db` - Database connectivity
- `/health/storage` - Storage availability

## Backup and Recovery

### Database Backups
- Supabase provides automatic daily backups
- Point-in-time recovery available
- Manual backups before major changes

### Disaster Recovery Plan
1. Database restore procedure documented
2. Environment variables backed up securely
3. DNS failover configured
4. Recovery time objective (RTO): < 1 hour
5. Recovery point objective (RPO): < 24 hours

## Scaling Considerations

### Database
- Current indexes support up to 100K+ records
- Connection pooling handles concurrent users
- Read replicas can be added if needed

### Application
- Lovable handles scaling automatically
- Consider CDN for global distribution
- Edge functions scale automatically

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication
- [x] Auto-confirm email signups enabled
- [ ] Two-factor authentication available
- [ ] Password strength requirements enforced
- [ ] Leaked password protection enabled (manual step)

### Data Protection
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) enforced
- [x] Customer data isolation
- [x] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Data encryption at rest (Supabase default)
- [ ] Data encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)

### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting on public endpoints
- [x] Input validation on all forms
- [x] SQL injection protection (Supabase client)
- [x] XSS prevention (React default)

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review security audit logs (weekly)
- Check error rates (daily)
- Monitor performance metrics (daily)
- Review database performance (weekly)
- Update dependencies (monthly)
- Security patches (as needed)

### Backup Verification
- Test restore procedure (quarterly)
- Verify backup integrity (monthly)
- Update disaster recovery plan (quarterly)

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Slow queries** - Check index usage, review query plans
2. **High error rates** - Check error logs, review recent deployments
3. **Authentication issues** - Verify environment variables, check RLS policies
4. **File upload failures** - Check storage bucket policies, verify file sizes
