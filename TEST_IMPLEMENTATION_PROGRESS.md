# Test Suite Implementation - Phase 6-8 Complete

## ✅ Newly Completed (Phases 6-8)

### Phase 6: Component Tests
- ✅ `admin-components.test.tsx` - UI component testing:
  - Customer management components
  - Order management with bulk operations
  - Invoice display and filtering
  - User management with role-based UI
  - Form validation
  - Loading and error states

### Phase 7: Edge Function Tests
- ✅ `wms-functions.test.ts` - Edge function validation:
  - `create-wms-user` - Auth, validation, role checks
  - `create-invoice-payment` - Stripe session creation, OMR conversion
  - `verify-invoice-payment` - Payment verification flow
  - `send-invoice-email` - Email delivery with Resend
  - `import-inventory-excel` - File upload and validation
  - Error handling and CORS
  - Security and logging

### Phase 8: Performance Tests
- ✅ `optimization.test.ts` - Performance benchmarks:
  - Query optimization (indexes, pagination, JOINs)
  - Dashboard metrics aggregation
  - Concurrent operations (orders, inventory, invoices)
  - Search performance (ILIKE, limits)
  - Bundle size optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)
  - Response time targets
  - Database connection pooling

### Bug Fix
- ✅ Fixed WMSUsers.tsx runtime error: Added null-safe navigation (`?.`) to prevent "Cannot read properties of null" error on toLowerCase() calls
