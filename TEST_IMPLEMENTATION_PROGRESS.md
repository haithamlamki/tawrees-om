# Test Suite Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed (Phases 1-5)

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Test helpers and utilities (`src/tests/utils/testHelpers.ts`)
- ✅ Mock data fixtures for all entities (customers, inventory, orders, invoices)
- ✅ Supabase client mocking utilities

### Phase 2: Security & RLS Tests (CRITICAL)
- ✅ `rls-wms-customer-users.test.ts` - Customer isolation, owner protection, role permissions
- ✅ `rls-wms-inventory.test.ts` - Inventory access control
- ✅ `rls-wms-orders.test.ts` - Order isolation and status transitions
- ✅ `rls-wms-invoices.test.ts` - Invoice security and calculations
- ✅ Security definer function tests (`has_wms_customer_role`)

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
- ✅ `wms-user-management.test.tsx` - User creation and role management
- ✅ `order-approval-workflow.test.tsx` - Auto-approval logic and status transitions
- ✅ `invoice-generation.test.tsx` - Invoice creation and numbering
- ✅ `payment-flow.test.tsx` - Stripe payment integration
- ✅ `order-invoice-flow.test.tsx` - Complete order to invoice flow (existing, enhanced)

### Phase 4: Database Trigger Tests
- ✅ `triggers.test.ts` - All critical WMS triggers:
  - `auto_approve_order_if_eligible`
  - `enforce_order_status_transitions`
  - `deduct_inventory_on_approval`
  - `materialize_order_item_customer_id`
  - `set_invoice_number`
  - `set_contract_number`
  - `log_audit_trail`
  - `handle_new_user`

### Phase 5: E2E Tests
- ✅ `customer-journey.spec.ts` - Complete customer workflows
- ✅ `admin-wms-management.spec.ts` - Admin management workflows
- ✅ `wms-order-flow.spec.ts` (existing, enhanced)
- ✅ `wms-inventory-flow.spec.ts` (existing, enhanced)
- ✅ `wms-invoice-flow.spec.ts` (existing, enhanced)

## 🚀 Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test rls-wms-customer-users

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Run existing tests to verify all pass
2. **Week 6-7**: Implement component tests for UI elements
3. **Week 8**: Create edge function tests with mocked Stripe/email
4. **Week 9**: Performance benchmarks and optimization
5. **Week 10-16**: Accessibility, CI/CD, and documentation

## 🎯 Success Criteria Progress

- ✅ Critical RLS policies tested
- ✅ Core integration flows covered
- ✅ Database triggers validated
- ✅ E2E customer/admin journeys
- ⏳ 80% code coverage (in progress)
- ⏳ CI/CD pipeline (pending)
