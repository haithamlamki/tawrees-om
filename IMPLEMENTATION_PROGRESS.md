# WMS Test Plan Implementation Progress

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

### Phase 1: Security & Data Integrity (Week 1) - ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Enabled password protection in auth configuration
- ✅ Created test seed data (`/supabase/seed/test.sql`)
- ✅ Created RLS denial tests (`/supabase/tests/rls_denial_test.sql`)

#### 1.2 Data Isolation & RLS ✅
- ✅ Materialized `customer_id` in `wms_order_items` table
- ✅ Added trigger to auto-populate `customer_id` from parent order
- ✅ Updated RLS policies to use direct `customer_id` checks (more efficient)
- ✅ Added indexes for performance (`idx_wms_order_items_customer_id`, `idx_wms_orders_status`, `idx_wms_orders_customer_status`)

#### 1.3 Order Approval Workflow ✅
- ✅ Status machine enforcement trigger (validates state transitions)

- ✅ Created `wms_invoice_sequences` table (per customer per year)
- ✅ Function `generate_invoice_number(customer_id)` with race condition locking
- ✅ Format: `CUSTCODE-INV-YYYY-0001` (consecutive, gaps allowed)
- ✅ Trigger to auto-generate invoice number on insert

#### 2.2 VAT Calculation ✅
- ✅ Added VAT fields to `wms_invoices` (`vat_rate`, `vat_exempt`, `vendor_vatin`, `customer_vatin`)
- ✅ Function `calculate_invoice_totals(invoice_id)` returns VAT-compliant totals
- ✅ 5% VAT default, supports zero/exempt items
- ✅ Rounding to 3 decimals (OMR baisa precision)

#### 2.3 Invoice Management ✅
- ✅ Created `wms_invoice_items` table with RLS policies
- ✅ Invoice generator UI (`/admin/wms-invoices`)
- ✅ Select multiple orders to invoice
- ✅ Automatic subtotal/VAT/total calculation
- ✅ Tax-compliant PDF component (`TaxCompliantInvoicePDF.tsx`)
  - ✅ Arabic/English headers ("Tax Invoice" / "فاتورة ضريبية")
  - ✅ VATIN fields for vendor and customer
  - ✅ VAT breakdown section
  - ✅ OMR currency with 3-decimal precision

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & WARNINGS

### Security Linter Warnings (Non-blocking):
1. **Security Definer View** - `customer_statistics` view (not critical, read-only aggregation)

3. **Leaked Password Protection** - Enabled in auth config ✅

### Technical Debt:
- Invoice PDF should be generated server-side (currently client-side)
- Excel import needs edge function (currently not implemented)
- Realtime subscriptions not set up
- Timezone not globally set to Asia/Muscat

---

## 📝 NOTES

- All database migrations are production-ready
